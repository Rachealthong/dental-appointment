Note from Eunice:

Dentist Management: 

1. Manage Booking: Basic function done, need to add CSS and best if can enable dentist to filter booking by date, patient's name etc?
patient_bio.php also done and can be clicked when clicking on patient's name, need to add CSS only. 
(smtg extra: make a checkbox in registration form to get consent from patients before using their data)

2. Update Availability: Basic function done, probably need to do the reverse - enable dentist to choose unavailable time slot and make it available 
(provided that there is no booking.) 
(Then in this case need to distinguish between unavailable time slot due to booking and unavailable time slot due to dentist's update)



Patient: 
1. Booking Appointment: 
Change the Date Selection into Calendar style ✅
For fetching available slots, though not much of a big difference, should we use dentist_id instead of dentist name as identifier since it is unique? 
Also note that we cant store info in JSON as prof doesnt allow. chatgpt suggested another workaround that i implemented in fetch_available_slots.php in Dentist Management✅

2. Manage Booking: 
- patient may possibly make multiple upcoming bookings for different services so need to allow display of multiple upcoming bookings.✅
- For rescheduling, I still think it is better to keep the old booking (and make rescheduled = 1 and free up the slot) and add a new row with the new booking.

3. Edit Profile: Pending 
- Add the ability for user to edit their profile details✅
- enabled in dentist domain too



More add-ons: Store the data to be displayed in service and dentist page in database and fetch from database instead of hardcoding in the file.


Then do a final check and touch up and it should be done!
