Note from Eunice:

Dentist Management: 

1. Manage Booking: Basic function done ✅, need to 
- manage_booking_dentist.php: add CSS 
- patient_bio.php: - add CSS

2. Update Availability: Basic function done ✅
- probably need to do the reverse - enable dentist to choose unavailable time slot and make it available 
(provided that there is no booking.) 
(Then in this case need to distinguish between unavailable time slot due to booking and unavailable time slot due to dentist's update)



Patient:
1. Manage Booking: 
- patient may possibly make multiple upcoming bookings for different services so need to allow display of multiple upcoming bookings.✅
- For rescheduling, I still think it is better to keep the old booking (and make rescheduled = 1 and free up the slot) and add a new row with the new booking.

2. Edit Profile: Pending 
- Add the ability for user to edit their profile details✅
- enabled in dentist domain too



More add-ons: Store the data to be displayed in service and dentist page in database and fetch from database instead of hardcoding in the file.


Then do a final check and touch up and it should be done!
