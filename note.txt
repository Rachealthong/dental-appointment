Note from Eunice:

Dentist Management: 

1. Manage Booking: 
- manage_booking_dentist.php: add CSS 
- patient_bio.php: - add CSS

Patient:
1. Manage Booking: 
- For rescheduling, I still think it is better to keep the old booking (and make rescheduled = 1 and free up the slot) and add a new row with the new booking.

More add-ons: 
- Store the data to be displayed in service and dentist page in database and fetch from database instead of hardcoding in the file.
- Enable dentists to edit service and dentist details


Then do a final check and touch up and it should be done!
