1. Update the pages with actual content.

2. Flush schedule to infinite date (a few months date) with duration of 30 minutes. 
Slight modification needed for update_availability.php (dentist)
Allow patients to book appointment 1 month in advance (instead of two weeks)

4. add more stuff under book appointment and manage appointment (without patient_login)

Then do a final check and touch up and it should be done!
